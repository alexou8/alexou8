## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student with strong interests in **backend systems, data-driven applications, and applied AI/ML**.  
I enjoy building **end-to-end solutions** — from system design and APIs to data pipelines and intelligent features — with a focus on **scalability, performance, and real-world impact**.

- Strong foundation in **data structures, algorithms, networking, and databases**
- Experience with **backend development, system-level design, and automation**
- Passionate about applying **AI/ML to solve practical problems**
